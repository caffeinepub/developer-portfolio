  "summary": "The implementation delivers a complete developer portfolio website that addresses all 10 requirements with professional design, animations, and structure. All major sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Resume, Contact) are implemented with appropriate scroll animations and hover effects. The design uses a neutral gray palette with emerald accent color, Inter typography, and modern minimal aesthetic. However, there are minor discrepancies in navigation hover effects implementation and the use of OKLCH color system instead of more standard color formats.",

      "reason": "The color system uses OKLCH format (e.g., '0.65 0.15 160' for accent color) which is a newer CSS color space. While functional, this was not specified in requirements which called for a 'neutral base color palette plus one accent color' without prescribing implementation details. Standard hex or RGB would be more conventional.",
