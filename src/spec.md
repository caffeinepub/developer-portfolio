## Summary
**Goal:** Build a modern, professional developer portfolio website with clean animations and recruiter-friendly design.

**Planned changes:**
- Create Hero section with title "Aspiring Software Developer | Computer Science Student", introduction paragraph, and CTA buttons ("View Projects", "Download Resume") with entrance animations
- Create About Me section with 5-6 line bio focusing on technical curiosity and career goals, with scroll-triggered fade-in animation
- Create Skills section with categorized grid layout (Languages, Frontend, Backend, Databases, Tools) and hover micro-interactions
- Create Projects section with professional cards displaying title, problem-focused description, tech stack, GitHub and Live Demo buttons, with hover animations
- Create Resume section with PDF download button and hover feedback
- Create Contact section with email display, GitHub/LinkedIn icon links, contact form, and interaction animations
- Implement smooth fade-in and slide-up scroll animations for all major sections
- Apply subtle hover effects throughout (buttons, cards, navigation items with animated underlines)
- Apply modern minimal design system with neutral base palette plus one accent color (avoiding blue and purple), high-quality typography (Inter or Poppins style), balanced whitespace, consistent spacing, and excellent contrast

**User-visible outcome:** A complete single-page developer portfolio website with professional animations, showcasing skills and projects in a clean, recruiter-friendly design suitable for college placements and job applications.
